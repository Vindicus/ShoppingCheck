ShoppingCheck
=============

This project is a shopping list app that I created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. This app allows users to add items to the shopping list under pre-defined categories. Users can also add their own category names.

The hardest part about this project was trying to figure out how user's items are appended to the category they selected:

1) I decided to create a switch statement for the selected category and append the list item
2) The other difficulty was trying to allow users to type their own category name and append that to the select list

The most interesting part was using the form elements such as the select list and the text box:

1) The form elements allows me to manipulate user data using jQuery event listeners and append them to the right category using switch statements
2) The other interesting part was allowing users to remove and highlight items that are completed using the click event listener, toggleClass, and the remove DOM element functions
